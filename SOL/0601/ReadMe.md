List 

   1. test.world
    
    This world is built to test resolution of IMU and "precision of holder" 
    which is kind a measurement to test that 
    'how far holder would take a ball in when it is out of central line and stands by side'   
    
    Try it by replacing 'map_final_ball.world' in map_generate folder
